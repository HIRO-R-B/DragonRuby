# Spacemacs Layer!
So far, only has a `company-dragonruby` package

By default `company-dragonruby` is off

`M-x company-dragonruby-on` to activate it

# Install
Add the `dragonruby` folder to `.emacs.d/private`

In your `.spacemacs` file, add the `dragonruby` layer
```elisp
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
'(
  ;; other layers, etc.
  dragonruby
  )
```
That's it!
